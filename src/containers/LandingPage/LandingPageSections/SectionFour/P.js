  <P>
    You may be wondering how we are able to give away money for free - it's
    simple. The companies who advertise on our platform pay us. When you win, we
    pay you. Winners have 24 hours to claim and it is essential to check your
    account on a daily basis. As our players increase so do our daily cash
    prizes. Â£10 bonus is added to your account every time you enter a draw and a
    double bonus is given every time a friend registers as a result of your
    referral. Be sure to share this page so that the cash draw is at its peak
    when your lucky day comes! Check Rules and FAQs for more information
